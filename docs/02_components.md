# System Components Deep Dive

## 1. Event Generator (`generateEvents`)

The Event Generator simulates user activity on a platform like Reddit:

```go
func generateEvents(eventChan chan<- map[string]interface{}, metrics *RedditMetrics, quit <-chan bool)
```

### How it works:
- Generates events every 100ms (10 events per second)
- Simulates different types of actions: posts, comments, upvotes, downvotes
- Uses channels for non-blocking communication
- Updates metrics in a thread-safe way using mutexes

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
The generator never waits for the database or processor - it keeps generating events regardless of what happens downstream, just like real users don't wait for the database to save their actions!

## 2. Database Writer (`storeEvents`)

The Database Writer persists events to PostgreSQL:

```go
func storeEvents(db *sql.DB, eventChan <-chan map[string]interface{}, metrics *RedditMetrics, quit <-chan bool)
```

### How it works:
- Listens continuously for new events
- Converts events to JSON for storage
- Uses parameterized SQL queries for safety
- Tracks performance metrics for each operation

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
The writer uses Go's built-in JSON marshaling to store complex data structures in PostgreSQL's JSONB format - this means we can store any type of event without changing our database schema!

## 3. Event Processor (`processEvents`)

The Event Processor handles batched updates:

```go
func processEvents(db *sql.DB, metrics *RedditMetrics, quit <-chan bool)
```

### How it works:
- Processes events in batches every 200ms
- Uses `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` for concurrent safety
- Updates multiple records in a single transaction
- Prevents duplicate processing through database locks

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
The `SKIP LOCKED` feature allows multiple processors to work simultaneously without conflicts - it's like multiple checkout lines in a supermarket, each processor can grab its own batch of events!

## 4. Metrics Visualizer (`visualizeMetrics`)

The Metrics Visualizer creates a real-time dashboard:

```go
func visualizeMetrics(metrics *RedditMetrics, quit <-chan bool)
```

### How it works:
- Updates every 500ms
- Uses ANSI colors for beautiful visualization
- Calculates real-time throughput and latency
- Shows activity bars for visual performance tracking

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
The visualizer demonstrates how a system can be both high-performance AND user-friendly - it processes thousands of events while providing real-time insights!

## Data Flow

1. Generator creates events â†’ sends to channel
2. Writer receives from channel â†’ saves to PostgreSQL
3. Processor reads from PostgreSQL â†’ marks as processed
4. Visualizer reads metrics â†’ updates dashboard

Each component runs independently in its own goroutine, demonstrating the power of Go's concurrency model!
