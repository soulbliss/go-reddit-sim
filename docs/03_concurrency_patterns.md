# Concurrency Patterns and Best Practices

## Core Concurrency Concepts

### 1. Goroutines
The system uses four main goroutines, each running independently:
```go
go generateEvents(eventChan, metrics, quit)
go storeEvents(db, eventChan, metrics, quit)
go processEvents(db, metrics, quit)
go visualizeMetrics(metrics, quit)
```

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
Each goroutine is like a separate worker in a factory - they all work simultaneously without waiting for each other!

## Communication Patterns

### 1. Channels
The system uses two types of channels:

#### Event Channel
```go
eventChan := make(chan map[string]interface{}, 100)
```
- Buffered channel with capacity of 100
- Prevents blocking when system is under load
- Acts as a queue between generator and writer

#### Quit Channel
```go
quit := make(chan bool)
```
- Unbuffered channel for shutdown signaling
- Used by all components for graceful shutdown
- Simple but effective coordination mechanism

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
Channels are like conveyor belts in a factory - they move data between workers (goroutines) safely and efficiently!

## Thread Safety

### 1. Mutex Usage
```go
type RedditMetrics struct {
    mutex sync.Mutex
    // ... other fields
}
```

The system uses mutexes to protect shared metrics:
- Lock before updating metrics
- Lock before reading metrics for visualization
- Minimal lock duration for better performance

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
Mutexes are like bathroom locks - only one person can enter at a time, preventing awkward situations! ðŸ˜„

## Database Concurrency

### 1. Connection Safety
- Single connection pool managed by `sql.DB`
- Automatic connection management
- Built-in connection pooling

### 2. Transaction Safety
```sql
SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
```
- Prevents double-processing of events
- Allows multiple processors to work simultaneously
- No explicit locking needed in application code

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
The database handles concurrency like a well-organized library - multiple people can check out books simultaneously without conflicts!

## Performance Patterns

### 1. Batched Processing
- Process multiple events in single transaction
- Reduces database load
- Improves throughput

### 2. Non-blocking Design
- Components never wait for each other
- System stays responsive under load
- Natural back-pressure handling

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
The system is like a highway with multiple lanes - even if one lane slows down, others keep moving!

## Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **Graceful Shutdown**
   - All components respond to quit signal
   - Clean database connection closure
   - No goroutine leaks

2. **Error Handling**
   - Errors logged but don't crash system
   - Continuous operation despite errors
   - Transparent error reporting

3. **Resource Management**
   - Proper channel closure
   - Database connection pooling
   - Memory-efficient processing

4. **Monitoring**
   - Real-time performance metrics
   - Visual feedback
   - Operation counters

### Aha Moment! ðŸŽ‰
The entire system is like a well-orchestrated symphony - each instrument (component) plays its part independently, but together they create beautiful music (efficient processing)!
